We knew something was off and should have left but didn't because we were with a group and knew it would be difficult to find another reservation so late.  Here is what occurred:\n1. The waiter brought a menu that was NOT the menu displayed on the website and told us the bartender is not working and therefore we cannot order any cocktails.\n2. We had to order 3 different bottles of wine before the waiter found one that was in stock.\n3. The waiter told us the chef asked if we could wait until a larger group had been served to place our order.\n4. After about an hour we were finally able to order\n5. The chef came over and told us he ran out of shrimp because the larger group ate them all\n6. The chicken brochette was brought to us completely undercooked (raw) and when we returned it, the chef rolled his eyes, and threw it back onto the grill with no apology, and also gave us the SAME, partially cut into skewer, rather than prepare a new one\n7. When we got the bill it still had the charge for the shrimp that we never got because it ran out and no courtesy of any credit as an apology for al that had occurred that night.\n8.  When my Parisian friend approached the chef on our exit and complained to him, he blew his cigarette in her face and said to her sarcastically ....  \"Did you think this was a restaurant gastronomique?!\"\n\nUm, YES, actually, we did because this is how you present yourself on your website, This was seriously the most horrible, shameful dining experience I have ever had ANYWHERE,  The owners and chefs should hang their heads in shame, how dare they treat customers this way or think anything like this was acceptable.  You deserve to go out of business, DO NOT GO HERE.\n",

Location was just outside the historic centre and in a tucked away, grungy location. \n\nThe staff were hospitable and spoke good english, presenting each individual dish and answering questions. \n\nMy partner and I had the chef's tasting menu, which included meat, seafood and vegetarian items. There was a special promotion for an additional 3 complimentary courses which left us leaving full and satisfied. \n\nThe dishes were inventive and fun, refined but not snobbish. Some were better than others but they overall rounded each other out and made for a fantastic overall experience. \n\nI had a glass of wine which while not fantastic, I will choose to overlook, as I would have gone for a bottle in hindsight as they looked to carry some great local natural wine options.\n\nIn summary: go here for a casual and non-stiff fine dining experience, the place is cozy, the staff are hospitable and most would find the dishes fun and agreeable. \n\nLook to spend an average of 70-80 euros per head for food and drink.

Not fantastic but considering the theme of the lunch set we understand that it is prepared in a certain way. For the experience, i would say we are paying 1836¥/set for the traditional way of selection & preparation of the food & free flow of drinks. The service was far off from the usual welcoming feel of other restaurants in japan. We were told that the explanation of the food in the lunch box is in that booklet, which was fine. After making the payment for the meal, we needed some hot water to bring away in such cold weather so my husband went to fill up 1 flask of hot plain water fm their beverage section and he was told that he cannot \"take-out\" the water & must pour away the water in his flask. I dont understand the rational. We couldn't ask in detail the reason because the waitress doesn't speak much english. Conversation with the staffs were a pain. So he just pour away the hot water. While we were leaving, i was asked by their waiter \"Did you pay?\" I just say yes & walked off. I'm totally offended by such question as if 6 of us would go to an empty restaurant, eat for free & walk off scott-free? No welcome, no thank you. Worst restaurant i have ever been to.",

            "text": "Stepping into this resto @rockwagyuhk , it brought me back to tokyo with its showa era style decor. We didn’t queue as we came to have late lunch at 3 pm on Sunday. \n\nWe have ordered 2 appetisers, 2 sets of wagyu—gyukatsu and diced Wagyu, which came with miso soup, dipping sauces, salad, pickles and a bowl of rice.  We have upgraded the rice bowl with a raw egg yolk and seaweed❤️❤️it was savoury and let you complete the whole bowl!\n\nThe wagyu was prepared to just above rare so you cooked each piece to your preferred temperature. We both chose to give our cuts on the hot stone to get it to medium. \n\nThe meat was tender, beautifully marbled and unforgettable. I love my cutlet beef, the crispy breading on the outside to the tenderness of the meat was just phenomenal!\n\nAnother highlight must be the wagyu tartare! It was as soft as the fatty tuna sashimi. The egg yolk gave it the silky texture with the mild tangy tasted sauce. \n\nWe finished our meal with their signature drink Fujiyama soda.  It was instagrammable, refreshing and not too sweet. \n\nThe restaurant fits the atmosphere perfectly and if you're looking for a more authentic Japanese experience. It is definitely worth seeking out but preferably avoid rush hour.",

            "text": "Cafe Joo is part of the Lubuds Restaurant Group. They opened up this casual and modern Korean restaurant on 1/F of the New Town Plaza shopping mall in Sha Tin earlier this year. Menu features dishes with Western influence so you have some traditional Korean cuisine along with pasta dishes and even a range of burgers.\n\nThere is a nice sized indoor seating section as well as some table outside which is quite rare in this part of Hong Kong. Opening hours are 11.30am to 10pm (weekdays) and 10am to 10pm (weekends). \n\nI had lunch here recently, menus are provided but you can use their wifi and online order app to look digital version of the menu and place orders. Service is friendly, my Wagyu w/ cheese burger combo was prepared and ready in less than 10 minutes. \n\nFood quality is better than you'd expect. The Wagyu burger was pretty good, reminded me that the old days of not being able to find a decent burger anywhere in the N.T. are long past. There are now burger specialists at New Town Plaza like Shake Shack and local outfit called Honbo and now Cafe Joo that grills up a nice quality burger topped with a fried pepper, fries, salad or soup and drink for lunch. \n\nBased on this experience, I'd be happy to take lunch at Cafe Joo. It is a good new restaurant at New Town Plaza. ",

Lunch time it’s very worth of the money to have lunch there. Service is very good and they are very professional in Italian ingredients as well.  They have own Italian food grocery in downstairs, very good one. They have real Italian Chef there, if call Italian Marco, the Chef,  and he is ready to do some adjustments i.e. you have some special wish about toppings on your pizza. I really recommend this nice atmosphere ristorante. They have great wine list as well.",

However, their Mushroom soup needs to be a little less creamy.  Iced tea is a little tangy but lemony sweet.\n\nBreakfast served is quite okay.  I loved best the choice of bacon and 2 eggs.  I love how they cook their bacons. Best with toast or rice.  I just took a taste of their congee but still finished it.  It's different from the congee I used to take in Manila.",

They have a Chinese restaurant inspired steak house theme.   They have dumpling and noodle appetizers.  The dumplings have diner style fillings in some of them, like pastrami or Reuben.  We had the crispy pork dumplings and they were delicious.   We also had an excellent Caesars salad.   The steaks were the star of the show.   They were thick and perfectly cooked.   They have a crispy filet mignon, which is battered and served with a dipping sauce.  It was pretty good, but just the steak was probably a better option.  The steaks were pretty big 12 oz, so come hungry or share.   They have some that are meant to be shared that are 20+ ounces, which we did not try.   We had mashed potatoes as a side and they were good but I would choose something else next time.   Martinis were good.   Ok wine list.   Nice service.  Super nice door man.   It’s not cheap, but for a nice occasion it’s worth it.",

Fortunately, we found a delicious restaurant nearby that was open for either a late lunch or early dinner. My daughter loved the Mediterranean esthetic of the restaurant, and the hostess gave us both a lunch and dinner menu since it was around 4 p.m. Our party of 4 started with the Pikilia which had tzatziki, hummus, eggplant, and olives on a lazy susan. Our server even provided us with additional complimentary pita. I ordered the charred octopus as an entree while the others in our party enjoyed the lobster pasta which was a generous portion of both lobster and pasta, the asparagus linguini, and a side of roasted artichokes. The Spanakopita was full of spinach and cheese. We were too stuffed for dessert! ",
